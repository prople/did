# prople/did/core

`DID (Decentralized Identity)` is a new kind of identifier that focus on decentralized digital
identity. A `DID` can be refer to 

- Thing
- Person
- Organization
- Data
- Model
- etc...

From the standard W3C : 

> The Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) defined in this specification are a new type of globally unique identifier. They are designed to enable individuals and organizations to generate their own identifiers using systems they trust. These new identifiers enable entities to prove control over them by authenticating using cryptographic proofs such as digital signatures.

The *decentralized identity* is one of primary objectives from `Prople`. There is no username, email or password used to identify an user in `Prople`. Any credential will be *own* and *controlled* by user.

Each of user will have their own `DID` with this format:

```text
did:prople:<base58btc_encoded_data>
```

Example:

```text
did:prople:z2xrsP3ExuJQMydq7hPg2d9ti3BKNoRSXE2b634vcdh9LKKujaBWLsPHoRgKcRCJ1ck7N5YcoU8ZmPwVqp5Hfnayj
```

This `DID` will be own by user without any centralized entity has an access to it. This `DID` will refer to its `DID Document` :

In `DID` user will have their own `VC (Verifiable Credentail)` and `VP (Verifiable Presentation)`. The `VC` will be generated by an `issuer` and will send to the `holder`. 

The `holder` itself will generate `VP` based on given `VC`. One `VP` may contains multiple `VC`. A `VP` can be used by a person as *user personal* for each of given `VC` (or group of `VC`).

The `verifier` will be used the `VP` from a `holder`, and should be able to verifiy its data structure / format through it's *proof* . The *proof* itself, generated and should be able to verified using cryptographic technique (`EdDSA` in `Prople`).

`Prople` users, will have their own `DID` including their `VC` and `VP` in their agent's storage.

Example of *secured* `VC` :
